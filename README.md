# Inventory_System
C482 - Software 1, Java

This program is an inventory management system built for a small manufacturing company.
The goal of the project was to replace their current system of inventory tracking in a 
spreadsheet with a program that would enable them to add, delete, and modify inventory.
The program tracks both parts and products, with products containing multiple parts which 
the user is able to add or delete per product.
